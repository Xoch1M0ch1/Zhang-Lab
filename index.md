# Where neurobiology and homeostasis go hand in hand 

The Zhang Lab is a research team at the [Oklahoma University Health Sciences Center](https://www.ouhsc.edu/) committed to answering the major and exciting questions regarding the neurobiology of homeostasis.  Our lab is focused on adapting new tools and developing novel protocols to further our knowledge in not only homeostasis, but also in body fluid balance and cilia diseases!

Our research is built on understanding how the nervous system senses external and interal stimuli, producing physiological and behavioral responses, and how "simple" malfunctions in a complex system contributes to human diseases.

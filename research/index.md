Our research centers on understanding how the nervous system senses external and interal stimuli to produce physiological and behavioral outputs, and how its malfunctions contribute to human diseases. To address this question, we established *C. elegans* as our animal model system, leveraging multidisciplinary strategies to combine neuroscience approaches, animal behavior recording, genetic screening, metabolomics, biochemistry, biophysics, and structural biology.  By using these approaches, we aim to identify receptors, signaling pathways, neural circuits, and inter-tissue communication patterns that drive homeostasis.  Furthermore, we also aim to discover the dyshomeostasis mechanisms underlying disease conditons and look for novel targets for treating human patients.

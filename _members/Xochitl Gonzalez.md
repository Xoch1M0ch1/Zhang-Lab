Xochitl is a laboratory technician for the Zhang lab.  She recently graduated from LSU in May 2024 with a degree in Biochemistry.  While at LSU, Xochitl worked in Dr. Morgan Kelly's lab, as an undergraduate researcher, investigating male and female differences in the copepod, *Tigriopus californicus*, which was the basis of her honors thesis.  After completing her thesis she realized she wanted to fully immerse herself in the world of research before committing herself to graduate school.  Outside of work, Xochitl likes to hike, bake, watch horror movies with her friends, and watercolor!

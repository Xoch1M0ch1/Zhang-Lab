Xinxing’s laboratory investigates the neurobiology of homeostasis using C. elegans, especially the mechanisms that mediate water balance, cilia diseases, and other environmental stresses.
 
Xinxing received his B.S. in Chemistry from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2010. Xinxing studied the biosynthesis of small pheromone molecules in C. elegans during his PhD in the laboratory of Dr. Rebecca Butcher at the University of Florida. In 2016, Xinxing switched his field of interest to neuroscience and joined Dr. Shawn Xu’s group at the University of Michigan. In 2023, Xinxing started his independent research group at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. Outside the lab, Xinxing likes nature walks and fishing.
